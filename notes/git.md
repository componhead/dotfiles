- `--assume-unchanged` assumes that a developer shouldn’t change a file. This flag is meant for improving performance for not-changing folders like SDKs.
- `--skip-worktree` is useful when you instruct git not to touch a specific file ever because developers should change it. For example, if the main repository upstream hosts some production-ready configuration files and you don’t want to accidentally commit changes to those files, --skip-worktree is exactly what you want.
- `git worktree add -b <newbranchname> <dirpath>`
